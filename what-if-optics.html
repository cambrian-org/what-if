    <h2>What if eyes could bend light?</h2>

    <p>
        Early visual systems faced a fundamental trade-off between light
        collection and acuity, progressing
        from simple light-sensitive patches to cup-shaped eyes with smaller
        apertures. While
        decreasing the size of the aperture and creating pinhole-like designs is
        a straightforward way to
        improve image formation, they severely limit light collection. This
        trade-off creates a performance
        ceiling, where further improvements in spatial resolution through
        pinhole designs are limited
        by the lack of light. This inherent limitation ultimately restricts the
        visual capabilities of such
        systems, causing a saturation in performance. We see this manifested in
        our results where agents
        with pinhole eyes plateau in fitness and are not able to achieve the
        performance benefits of improved spatial resolution.
        What if we introduced optical elements that can redirect light into
        our agents? Lenses emerged as a innovation in biological evolution and
        we investigate the impact
        of enabling optical elements capable of bending light in our framework.

        We examined how adding optical elements could alter the evolutionary
        path of vision in agents performing a DETECTION task. First, in the
        <em>EYE
            WITHOUT OPTICS</em> experiment, only pupil size could mutate,
        mimicking early eye evolution. Initially, agents had fully open
        apertures
        for maximum light intake but poor image sharpness. Over generations,
        they
        evolved cup-shaped eyes to reduce blur and eventually near-pinhole eyes,
        balancing sharpness and brightness. This progression demonstrated the
        natural trade-off between spatial resolution and light collection.

        At generation 30, we introduced optical elements in the <em>EYE WITH
            OPTICS</em> experiment, allowing agents to mutate lens shape and
        refractive index. The initial random lenses reduced performance, but by
        generation 50, they evolved into slightly convex shapes, showing early
        lens-like focusing. Eventually, agents developed well-defined lenses
        with
        symmetric point spread functions while maintaining larger pupils. This
        overcame the pinhole trade-off, enabling both sharp vision and higher
        light throughput, leading to improved task performance.

        The lens represents a fundamental innovation in the evolutionary
        solution space
        to account for the demands of achieving accurate environmental
        perception.
