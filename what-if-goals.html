    <h2>What if the goals for vision were different?</h2>

    <p>
        We initialize a population of agents for two visual tasks (DETECTION and
        NAVIGATION) with a single eye with one photoreceptor. We then evolve
        this
        population of agents subject
        to morphological mutations: add photoreceptor, add eye, and adjust
        placement. In the NAVIGATION task, we first observe an emergence of
        dispersed vision, where many eyes are employed. By
        50 generations, a compound-type eye emerges; that is, a vision system
        consisting of 10 individual eyes, each with 16 photoreceptors (4 x 1
        resolution), distributed over the entire diameter of
        the agent. In the DETECTION task, we initially observe the emergence
        low-resolution vision.
        After 50 generations, the population has converged on a morphology
        consisting of two forward
        facing, high-resolution camera-type eyes each with 225 photoreceptors
        (15Ã—15 resolution). </p>

    <p>
        This evolutionary divergence reflects task-specific optimization: NAVIGATION
        agents maximize spatial
        awareness through distributed low-resolution sensing, while DETECTION
        agents sacrifice peripheral
        vision for enhanced frontal acuity, enabling object discrimination at
        greater distances within their
        fixed time constraint.
