    <h2>But... why do we care about eyes...?</h2>

        I think the question that we should instead ask is:

        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> <em> Can we computationally discover
                and innovate like nature has over the last 3.5 billion years?</em>
        </h4>

        One way to do it would be mimic, or copy, how nature has evolved
        eyes over the last 3.5 billion years. If we can replicate the process
        computationally and
        have the right computational models of biological phenomena, then maybe
        we can also computationally discover
        new things. Vision is exciting because natural vision has far outpaced
        artificial vision in not only
        performance and robustness, but also in the diversity of solutions found
        under the constraints that earth has
        provided.

        By having the sufficiently plausible computational models for biological
        phenomena and mimicking the process of discovery,
        we can study science on a large scale and invent more intelligent visual
        machines.
        Our framework opens up exciting possibilities for both science and
        engineering.
        For biologists and cognitive scientists, it offers a way to
        test different hypotheses—like separating the role of optics from neural
        processing or understanding how environmental pressures shape eye
        evolution. What’s especially fascinating about computational evolution
        is that it doesn’t just
        replicate known pathways; it even stumbled upon compound-eye
        architectures on its own, without being explicitly designed to do so.

        For engineers, these evolutionary simulations provide valuable insights
        into building artificial visual machines that balance performance with
        real-world constraints like energy efficiency and manufacturability.
        Moving forward, we could push this even further by adding more
        environmental factors or combining evolutionary strategies with machine
        learning to accelerate the discovery of even more efficient and creative
        solutions.
